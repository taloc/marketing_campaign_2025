# Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a sample marketing campaign performance dataset for a data analysis dashboard, created for a freelancing project for a digital marketing agency. The agency seeks a Power BI dashboard to track the performance of email and social media campaigns over the past six months. The goal is to evaluate which campaigns drive the most customer purchases and analyze channel performance over time to refine the marketing strategy for the second half of the year. The dashboard focuses on four key areas:

- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Measuring the profitability of campaigns.
- **Conversion Rates**: Assessing the percentage of audience converted into customers.
- **Audience Engagement**: Evaluating engagement scores to gauge audience interaction.
- **Channel Performance**: Analyzing the effectiveness of channels like Google Ads, YouTube, Instagram, and Website.
